The first step was loading of caret. Next, the training set was loaded. Then I explored data to check meaning of columns. It turned out that columns 1:7 are useless for machine learning, so they were removed. Data contain a lot of missing values, columns with missing values were removed. The training set was paritioned to \"real\" training set and in-training validation set (50+50 %). It was trained by Random Forest with a cross-validation. The result was:\r\n\r\n```{R}\r\n> rfmod\r\nRandom Forest \r\n\r\n9812 samples\r\n  52 predictors\r\n   5 classes: 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E' \r\n\r\nNo pre-processing\r\nResampling: Cross-Validated (10 fold) \r\nSummary of sample sizes: 8831, 8831, 8833, 8830, 8831, 8831, ... \r\nResampling results across tuning parameters:\r\n\r\n  mtry  Accuracy   Kappa      Accuracy SD  Kappa SD   \r\n   2    0.9876685  0.9843997  0.003733782  0.004722544\r\n  27    0.9893004  0.9864663  0.004136378  0.005229355\r\n  52    0.9797192  0.9743445  0.006765749  0.008556532\r\n\r\nAccuracy was used to select the optimal model using  the largest value.\r\nThe final value used for the model was mtry = 27. \r\n> rfmod$finalModel\r\n\r\nCall:\r\n randomForest(x = x, y = y, mtry = param$mtry) \r\n               Type of random forest: classification\r\n                     Number of trees: 500\r\nNo. of variables tried at each split: 27\r\n\r\n        OOB estimate of  error rate: 1.05%\r\nConfusion matrix:\r\n     A    B    C    D    E class.error\r\nA 2778    9    2    0    1 0.004301075\r\nB   16 1875    8    0    0 0.012638231\r\nC    0   17 1682   12    0 0.016949153\r\nD    0    1   23 1581    3 0.016791045\r\nE    0    1    4    6 1793 0.006097561\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen Figure 1 was prepared to illustrate the progress of Random Forest algorithm:\r\n\r\n![Figure 1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8507616/10480659/bb6f5a10-726b-11e5-82dc-956b899b2da5.png)\r\n\r\nThe outcomes for the in-training validation set were predicted and the confusion matrix was calculated and ploted as Figure 2:\r\n\r\n![Figure 2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/8507616/10480661/bfbbf4e8-726b-11e5-90ed-2a64fb0b94e8.png)\r\n\r\nFinally, the test dataset was loaded, unused columns and columns with missing data were removed and prediction was made:\r\n\r\n```{R}\r\n> second.pred <- predict(rfmod, testing.pure)\r\n> second.pred\r\n [1] B A B A A E D B A A B C B A E E A B B B\r\nLevels: A B C D E\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
